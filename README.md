# Deep Reinforcement Learning Applied to Atari MsPacman

* Created a tabular reinforcement learning environment.
* Applied Q-learning in the environment created.
* Applied Soft Actor Critic to Atari MsPacman.
* Applied Deep Q-Network to Atari MsPacman.

## Packages
**Python Version**: 3.8.3

**Main Packages used**:
* opencv-python==4.5.1.48
* torch==1.8.1
* torchvision==0.9.1

**Requirements**: 
`<pip install -r requirements.txt>`

## Conclusion 
* DQN outperforms SAC in Atari MsPacman, which suggests that DQN performs better than SAC when the environment has complex rules and uncertainty.
